Medieval Clicker is an idea based mostly in "clicker" game style, inspired by games like Age of Empires. Rather than use the framework to create applications like web pages or mobile applications, I'm using its powers to create a kind of game that is much dependent on user interface capabilities.

This project is a mix of studies using react web framework with non-natural purposes, with the objective to present my expertise using react ecosystem and derived.
